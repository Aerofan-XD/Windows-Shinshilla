Windows Shinshilla - converted to ASP.NET Core (C#)
This project was autogenerated by a script that converted the Flask templates and static files into an ASP.NET Core MVC skeleton.
How to run:
1. Install .NET 8 SDK (or adjust TargetFramework in csproj).
2. From the project folder, run: dotnet run
3. The app will listen on the default ports. Static files are under wwwroot/static.
Notes:
- The otzivy (reviews) page uses a reviews.json file in the project root to store reviews.
- Some complex Jinja features were converted heuristically; manual adjustments may be necessary.
